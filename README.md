<h2>Context</h2>

This patient appointment case study provides a comprehensive analysis of appointment attendance based on demographic factors such as age and gender. It also delves into the correlation between attendance and health conditions, including hypertension, alcoholism, and diabetes, as well as the distinction between scholarship holders and non-scholarship holders. With a dataset of 110,526 records, this study aims to uncover insights into factors influencing patient attendance and inform strategies for improving appointment adherence in healthcare settings.


<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>Demographic Insights:
The average age of patients is 37 years, with the oldest patient being 115 years old.
The dataset comprises a total of 110,526 patient appointments.</b>
- <b>Appointment Attendance:
79.8% of patients (88,207) showed up for their appointments, while 20.2% (22,319) did not.
Females accounted for 64.9% (57,245) of appointments that were attended, whereas males accounted for 35.1% (30,962).</b>
- <b>Age Distribution:
The highest age group for appointments was adults aged 24-64 years, accounting for 53.6% (47,237) of appointments.
The lowest age group was infants aged 0 years, comprising 3.3% (2,900) of appointments.</b>
- <b>Health Condition Insights:
Hypertension was the most prevalent health condition, with 21,801 patients diagnosed, but only 18,029 showed up for their appointments.
Among adults, hypertension patients accounted for the highest count. </b>
- <b>Scholarship Holder Attendance:
76.3% (8,283) of scholarship recipients attended their appointments.</b>









<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- <b> Targeted Communication for Appointment Reminders:
Develop customized communication strategies for appointment reminders, considering the higher attendance rate among females compared to males. Tailoring reminders to different demographic groups may improve overall attendance rates.</b>
- <b>Focus on Adult Health Education and Management:
Given that adults aged 24-64 years represent the highest age group and have the highest count of hypertension patients, prioritize health education and management programs tailored to this demographic. Addressing hypertension among adults may lead to better appointment adherence and health outcomes.</b>
- <b>Early Intervention for Infant Appointments:
Implement early intervention strategies for infant appointments, considering they comprise the lowest age group in attendance. Providing additional support and resources to parents or caregivers of infants may encourage better appointment adherence.</b>
- <b>Scholarship Holder Support Programs:
Continue to support scholarship recipients, as they demonstrate a higher attendance rate compared to non-scholarship holders. Implement targeted support programs or incentives to further encourage attendance among this group.</b>
- <b>Improved Appointment Scheduling and Accessibility:
Explore options for flexible appointment scheduling and improved accessibility, particularly for patients with chronic conditions like hypertension. Providing convenient appointment times and telehealth options may help overcome barriers to attendance.</b>
- <b>Health Literacy Initiatives:
Invest in health literacy initiatives aimed at all patient demographics to improve understanding of the importance of attending appointments, particularly for managing chronic conditions. Clear communication about the consequences of missed appointments can motivate patients to prioritize attendance.</b>
- <b>Data-Driven Outreach and Follow-Up:
Utilize data analytics to identify patients at higher risk of missing appointments, such as those with chronic conditions or infants, and implement proactive outreach and follow-up measures. Personalized communication and reminders based on patient demographics and health status can improve appointment adherence.<b>
